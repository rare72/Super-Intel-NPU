LINUX LEGACY WORKFLOW NOTES (ARCHIVED 2026-01-27)
===================================================

This document contains instructions for the Legacy Linux environment, which has been superseded by the Windows 11 / MSVC v145 toolchain.

These instructions are preserved for reference only and are NOT compatible with the active Windows environment.

### Previous Linux Quick Start

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    ```bash
    ./archive/scripts/linux_setup_env.sh
    ```

2.  **Bake the Model:**
    Downloads and converts the model to NPU-optimized INT4.
    ```bash
    python src/python/bake_model.py
    ```

3.  **Run Inference (Recommended):**
    Use the master launch script to ensure hardware health and proper logging.
    ```bash
    ./archive/linux_launch.sh
    ```

### Linux Diagnostic Tools

The project included a suite of tools to prevent NPU hangs on the Linux Kernel driver:

*   **`./archive/linux_launch.sh`**: The master switch. Handles Hard Reset -> Vitals Check -> Execution.
*   **`archive/scripts/linux_npu_reset.sh`**: Hard resets the Linux kernel NPU driver (use if device disappears).

### Notes on Linux Failure
The Linux environment suffered from severe driver instability on the Intel Ultra 5 225 (Rev 10) "ArrowLake" CPU. The decision was made to migrate to Windows 11 24H2 where the MCDM driver model provides better stability for this specific silicon revision.
