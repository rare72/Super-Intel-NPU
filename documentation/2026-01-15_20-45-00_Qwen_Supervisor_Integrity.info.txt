Task: Add Model Integrity Check and NPU_TURBO Flag to Qwen Supervisor

Author: Jules

Summary of Changes:
Modified `src/python/supervisor_qwen.py` to prevent the execution of truncated/broken models and to allow user configuration of the NPU Turbo mode.

Detailed Implementation Notes:
1.  **Model Integrity Check**:
    *   Added logic to inspect the size of `openvino_model.bin` before attempting compilation.
    *   **Threshold**: If the model binary is smaller than 2.0 GB (expected ~5GB for 8B INT4), the script now logs a `CRITICAL` error and exits immediately with code 1.
    *   **Reasoning**: Previous bake attempts resulted in truncated ~500MB models, which caused the NPU compiler to hang indefinitely while trying to process the broken graph. This check ensures only valid models are sent to the driver.

2.  **NPU_TURBO Configuration**:
    *   Added a CLI argument `--npu_turbo`.
    *   Default behavior remains `NPU_TURBO="NO"` (Safe Mode) to prevent driver crashes.
    *   If `--npu_turbo` is passed, the property `{"NPU_TURBO": "YES"}` is sent to the OpenVINO NPU plugin. This allows advanced users to experiment with performance modes if their specific driver version is stable.

Usage Instructions:
Standard (Safe) Launch:
`python src/python/supervisor_qwen.py --model_dir ./models/qwen3_int4`

Turbo Mode (Experimental):
`python src/python/supervisor_qwen.py --model_dir ./models/qwen3_int4 --npu_turbo`

Fixes & Caveats:
*   **Fix**: Prevents "Silent Hangs" caused by loading truncated ~500MB models.
*   **Feature**: Adds runtime control over NPU power/performance states.

Technical Metrics:
*   **Integrity Threshold**: 2.0 GB.
*   **Default Turbo**: OFF.
