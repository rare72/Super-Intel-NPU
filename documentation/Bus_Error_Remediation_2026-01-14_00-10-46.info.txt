Task: Bus Error Remediation (Memory Management)
Date: 2026-01-14_00-10-46

Summary of Incident:
During the model baking process, a `Bus error (core dumped)` occurred during the remediation step. This indicates that the system ran out of addressable memory or file handles because the script was holding two copies of the 7B model in RAM simultaneously (Optimum's PyTorch/OpenVINO wrapper AND the OpenVINO Core runtime object).

Detailed Diagnosis:
1.  **Double Loading**:
    -   `model = OVModelForCausalLM...` loads the model (~4GB in RAM).
    -   `ov_model = core.read_model...` loads a second copy for reshaping.
    -   On memory-constrained systems (like the "slave1b" node), this triggers an OOM killer or Bus Error when mmap fails.

2.  **The Fix**:
    -   Implemented aggressive Garbage Collection (`gc`) in `bake_model.py`.
    -   Explicitly `del model` and `gc.collect()` immediately after saving the initial binary and *before* starting the remediation.
    -   This ensures the first copy is flushed from RAM before the second copy is loaded.

Action Required:
-   **Re-run Bake**: The user must run the bake command again. The script is now safe for lower-memory environments.

Technical Metrics:
-   **Peak Memory Reduction**: Estimated ~50% reduction in peak RAM usage during the bake process.
