Task: Enable Verbose Logging and Diagnostics for Qwen3 Supervisor

Date: 2026-01-15
Author: Jules

Summary of Changes:
Modified `src/python/supervisor_qwen.py` to enable granular logging and system diagnostics. This addresses user reports of silent "crashes" or hangs during the lengthy NPU compilation phase.

Detailed Implementation Notes:
1.  **Logging Infrastructure**:
    *   Replaced standard `print()` statements with the python `logging` module.
    *   Configured logging to output to `sys.stdout` with timestamps (`%(asctime)s`).
    *   Added `sys.stdout.flush()` calls before critical blocking operations (like `compile_model`) to ensure the user interface updates immediately, even if buffering is active.

2.  **OpenVINO Verbosity**:
    *   Enabled internal OpenVINO logs via `core.set_property({"LOG_LEVEL": "LOG_INFO"})`.
    *   Specifically targeted the NPU plugin with `core.set_property("NPU", {"LOG_LEVEL": "LOG_DEBUG"})`. This will stream detailed driver events (compilation progress, memory allocation) to the console, helping distinguish between a "hang" and "work in progress".

3.  **System Diagnostics**:
    *   Added a call to `free -h` via `subprocess` immediately before model loading. This logs the available RAM/Swap, helping diagnose if the OOM (Out of Memory) killer is terminating the process during the compilation spike.
    *   Added a file existence check for `openvino_model.xml` along with its file size logging. This confirms the bake was successful before attempting to load.

Usage Instructions:
No change to invocation commands. The output will now be significantly more verbose automatically.
`python src/python/supervisor_qwen.py --model_dir ./models/qwen3_int4 ...`

Fixes & Caveats:
*   **Fix**: Provides visibility into the "Black Box" of NPU model compilation.
*   **Fix**: Helps differentiate between Driver Hangs, OOM Kills, and Slow Compilation.

Technical Metrics:
*   **Log Level**: INFO (Global), DEBUG (NPU Plugin).
*   **Diag Tool**: `free -h` (Memory).
