Task: Update Qwen3 INT8 Supervisor Default Device and Fallback
Date: 2026-01-16
Author: Jules

Summary of Changes:
Modified `src/python/supervisor_qwen_int8.py` to prioritize NPU execution as the default behavior, with automatic fallback to GPU and then CPU if loading fails.

Detailed Implementation Notes:
1.  **Default Device Change**:
    *   Updated the `__init__` method and `argparse` default value from `"GPU"` to `"NPU"`.
    *   This sets the NPU as the primary target for the INT8 dynamic model experiment.

2.  **Fallback Logic**:
    *   Implemented a retry loop in the `load()` method.
    *   If the requested device is `"NPU"`, the supervisor constructs a fallback chain: `["NPU", "GPU", "CPU"]`.
    *   It attempts to load the model on each device sequentially.
    *   Logs errors for failed attempts and proceeds to the next device.
    *   Exits with a critical error only if all devices in the chain fail.

Usage Instructions:
Standard Run (Defaults to NPU -> GPU -> CPU):
`python3 src/python/supervisor_qwen_int8.py`

Explicit Override (No fallback if specified):
`python3 src/python/supervisor_qwen_int8.py --device GPU`

Fixes & Caveats:
*   **Fix**: Aligns default behavior with user preference for NPU priority.
*   **Caveat**: Dynamic shapes on NPU are still experimental; the fallback logic ensures the script remains usable even if the NPU driver rejects the dynamic model.

Technical Metrics:
*   **Default Priority**: NPU > GPU > CPU.
