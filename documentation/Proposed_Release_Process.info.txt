Proposed Release Process (Draft)

Summary:
This document outlines the proposed workflow for packaging the New Offering for distribution. This process is currently NOT implemented in the active codebase but is documented here for future reference.

Process Overview:
1.  **Artifact Consolidation:**
    - Collect the `supervisor.py` script.
    - Collect the compiled C++ Executive binary (`executive_shard`).
    - Collect the baked model directory (containing `openvino_model.xml`, `.bin`, and tokenizer configs).

2.  **Directory Structure:**
    Create a `release_vX.X/` folder with the following layout:
    ```
    release_v1.0/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── executive_shard  (C++ Binary)
    ├── models/
    │   └── [Model_Name]/    (Baked Artifacts)
    ├── supervisor.py        (Python Runtime)
    └── run.sh               (User Entry Point)
    ```

3.  **Runner Script (`run.sh`):**
    A shell script should be generated to abstract the Python command arguments. It should:
    - Set the PYTHONPATH if necessary.
    - Point `--model_xml` to the local `models/` subdirectory.
    - Point `--device` to NPU by default.

4.  **Distribution:**
    - The `release_v1.0/` folder can be zipped and distributed to end-users.
    - Users only need to install the Intel drivers and Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (or a setup script).

Reasoning:
This approach isolates the runtime environment from the development source code (`src/`), ensuring end-users do not accidentally modify baking logic or build scripts.
